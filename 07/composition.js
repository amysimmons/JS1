Composition over inheritance

Exercise - Make the following enhancements:

Uber is a driver, and an app (with an .install() function)

DogSim2000 is an app and a barker (but not a pooper!)

Create instances, and trigger their functionality

driver's need fuel!
  Add a showRemainingFuel() method
  Add a refuel() method to top up
  Change drive() to take away some fuel each time it is called

Test your changes out in node by running node index.js.
